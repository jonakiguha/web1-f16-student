								<p>
									
									<ow2>Bauhaus design is something that has fascinated me for a very long time. I love having a sort of chaos within structure. This website has some really intresting explorations and works of design.</ow2>

									<h2>Why I am taking this class & what I hope to achieve through it?</h2>
									
									<p>
										<body>
										
										<p>I think that web design is a very important aspect of Graphic Design. I know nothing about it as of yet but have seen some great work in terms of identity and design done by other designers and have always been curious as to how they bring it to life through the interweb. I hope to learn atleast the basics and then maybe take that forward myself to by incorporating it with graphic design.</p>
