	    <p>Design has always been a backburner passion for me. The summer before I left for college, I interned at a advertising production house and it was then that I realized the passion I had for creative creation. 
			<p>Studying at Massachusetts College of Art and Design and actually exploring different aspects of design and everything Graphic Design has to offer has been beyond any experience I can define. I have learned more than I could ever image and do something that I've never really done - EXPLORE.</p>
			<p>I've found a higher amount of interest in Editorial Design as well as UI/UX. There is still a lot to be done since I'm still learning but I love playing around with color, layout, identity, illustrations and design. I also do a little photograpahy on the side and some of it has also incorporated itself into my work. I originally reside in Mumbai, India and am presently in the states just to persue my education</p>
