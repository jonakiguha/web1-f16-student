	<h1>ABOUT</h1>
	
	<p> A junior studying Metals and Jewelry at MassArt, Aditi wants to build her first portfolio website. In addition to it being a portfolio she also wants to have some objects for sale. Originally hailing from Hyderabad, India - Aditi likes to incorporate different cultural aspects in her work without appropriating it. For now all her work coresponds to her Indian culture because that's what she understand best but definitely plans on expanding soon. Her work includes jewelry, small metals work, vessels, tableware and experimentation with different sorts of materials. Following her undergraduate degree she plans's on moving to London to persue a MBA degree and start her own business thereafter in India. </p>
	<p> In terms of websites she'd like to stay away from the very bohemian sort of websites because even though most of her work is sculptural in look they all have a very different message to convey. She'd like to express that message and have a small write-up with all her work recording her inspiration and what the work stands for. She'd also like to stray away from a very commercial website but rather just have a simple one with good images bringing out what she does. </p>

<h2>Porcupillo</h2>


<p>This hybrid animal is made entirely of copper sheet that was bent up and pierced to create a 3D figure. It is inspired by both an armadillo and a porcupine, hence, the name.</p>


<h2>The Oracle</h2>


<p>This piece is made to predict your death. It is a satirical play on how everyone is afraid of dying, but don’t live to the fullest either. It uses the reader’s favorite food, color and their horoscope to predict the time they have left. It is made of copper, cold joined together and etched.</p> 


<h2>Repousse Sikke Series</h2>


<p>This piece is a direct representation of the a Five Rupee coin from India. It is made of hammered and textured copper.</p>


<h2>Vessel Sikke Series</h2>


<p>This vessel is made of copper in three separate pieces. It is inspired by my home country-India. The bottom two pieces of the vessel are raised, pierced and etched pieces of copper that represent the national flower of India- the Lotus. The top piece is pierced with an abstracted version of the map of India. It is tinned on the inside and colored black on the outside. Each of these pieces is removable for easy packing.</p>


<h2>Khaana Banana</h2>


<p>This series represents my favorite foods from home. There are a total of five dishes here- bhindi, kaddhi, biryani, chai and lassi. They have all been enamelled onto copper disks over layers of layers. The cutlery and vessels were not made by me. I named this series Khaana Banana because in Hindi this means making food, and I wanted to take about the process of making my favorite foods in my favorite medium- metal.</p>
