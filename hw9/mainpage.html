	<h2>ABOUT</h2>
	
	
	    <p>I started exploring with illustrations after I entered Graphic Design. I taught myself how to use a tablet and realized that I do actually possess a style. I've always been fond of drawing but hated the messiness of it all; but going digital changed all that. The illustrations that I've done are mostly icons. There are just a few posters which are completely illustration based and I've incorporated my silkscreen-looking and a somewhat informal styling to it.</p> 
	    <p>I wouldn't want all my work to be showcased. Just the ones that I would want to show and think possess caliber. Also the ones that I think show that I have skills required for a job such as layout, color, type, etc.</p>
		<p>I do photograpahy on the side just for myself but somehow it has incorporated itself into some of my work so I would definitely want to have a seperate place for that within my website portfolio.</p>
