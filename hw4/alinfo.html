	<h1>Aditi Lakhtakia</h1>
	
	<p> A junior studying Metals and Jewelry at MassArt, Aditi wants to build her first portfolio website. In addition to it being a portfolio she also wants to have some objects for sale. Originally hailing from Hyderabad, India - Aditi likes to incorporate different cultural aspects in her work without appropriating it. For now all her work coresponds to her Indian culture because that's what she understand best but definitely plans on expanding soon. Her work includes jewelry, small metals work, vessels, tableware and experimentation with different sorts of materials. Following her undergraduate degree she plans's on moving to London to persue a MBA degree and start her own business thereafter in India. </p>
	<p> In terms of websites she'd like to stay away from the very bohemian sort of websites because even though most of her work is sculptural in look they all have a very different message to convey. She'd like to express that message and have a small write-up with all her work recording her inspiration and what the work stands for. She'd also like to stray away from a very commercial website but rather just have a simple one with good images bringing out what she does. </p>
